## Origin
I created this project because the number of modern SkyBlock QOL mods is too little. For me, who is a modern version lover, [SkyBlocker] was the only choice. However, though I loved the mod, it's so lightweight that it did not provide some of the features which were necessary to me. On the other hand, I did not want to break the lightweight of the mod (since it's one of the most standing-out features of the mod), I created the mod, focusing on the power feature that used to only exist on 1.8 mods.
